The Network Path Optimizer is a Python-based application that helps users find the shortest route between two devices in a computer network. By implementing Dijkstra's algorithm, it calculates the shortest path based on given latencies between network devices. The app also visually displays both the initial network topology and the optimized path for user clarity, with edges color-coded to highlight the shortest path.
